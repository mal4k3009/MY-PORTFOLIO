            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>From an early age, I have always been drawn to the world of technology. I remember tinkering with computers and trying to understand how different systems operated. That early curiosity eventually led me to pursue formal education in Computer Science. As a student, I’ve had the opportunity to explore various subjects and technologies, such as Web Development, UI/UX Development, and Programming and learning different languages. Each step has deepened my understanding and love for how powerful technology can be in transforming ideas into reality.</p>

            <p>One of the key milestones in my journey has been working on Sign2Speak. These project allowed me to not only learn technical skills but also work on critical thinking, collaboration, and adapting to challenges. I find problem-solving to be both exciting and fulfilling, especially when working with others to find innovative solutions.</p>

            <p>I am constantly seeking out new challenges that allow me to expand my horizons. Whether it’s learning new programming languages, attending tech workshops, or collaborating on team projects, I am dedicated to continuous learning and growth.</p>
